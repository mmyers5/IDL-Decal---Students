\begin{itemize}
\item I enjoy not indenting in \LaTeX
\item I enjoy getting help from Joe at all times
\end{itemize}
\begin{enumerate}
\item I hate being here on the day before thanksgiving break at 6pm
  working on this shiz just because it is due today
\item I hate how the textbook isn't compeltley written so its hard to
  find help outside of Joe, Austin, and Chris.
\end{enumerate}
\begin{equation}
\sum_{j=0}^{n}(-1)^{j} \partial^{j}_{\mu1 \dotsb \mu j} \left(\frac{\partial
  L}{\partial f_{i, \mu1 \dotsb \mu j}}\right)=0
\end{equation}  
The are many $\mu$'s you have to deal with which is why $\mu1 \dotsb \mu
j$ is there.
